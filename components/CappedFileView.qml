// Capped, regular-file-gated replacement for FileView on watched mutable files.
//
// Why this exists: Quickshell's FileView loads a file's entire contents into
// shell memory at the read boundary (it allocates a buffer of file.size() and
// reads into it) before any QML can inspect the bytes. A hostile large file
// can therefore bloat the long-lived shell, and a non-regular file (FIFO)
// swapped in at the path can stall a reader — a post-hoc byte ceiling like
// DockModel.readCapped(FileView.text()) is applied too late. The cap has to
// apply BEFORE the file is loaded into QML.
//
// Mechanism: FileView here is a change *watcher* only (preload: false and no
// reload()/text()/data() call ever, so it never loads content). Content enters
// QML exclusively through the gate below — a one-shot process that first
// verifies the path is a readable regular file and then reads it bounded by
// maxBytes + 1, so it can tell "within the cap" from "over it" by counting the
// bytes it actually read. The reader is additionally bounded in time
// (timeout), so a FIFO swapped past the check can never hold a worker.
//
// The size is never taken from a stat() of the path and then trusted. Watched
// files are written atomically (FileView atomicWrites: temp file + one
// rename) and they grow as the user works, so a size read a moment before the
// rename describes the OLD file: reading exactly that many bytes of the new
// one emitted a truncated prefix of it. For omadock.json that prefix is not
// JSON, and the dock's answer to a parse failure is defaults — which emptied
// the preset list it held in memory right after a preset was saved.
//
// Behavior parity with the old FileView path:
//   - missing / non-regular / unreadable -> nothing happens (FileView's
//     loadFailed also left state untouched and never fired onLoaded)
//   - oversized regular file -> text becomes "" and loaded() fires (matches
//     DockModel.readCapped, which yields "" for over-cap input)
//   - small regular file -> text = contents, loaded() fires
//
// Writes never read the file (FileView.setText writes exactly what it is
// given), so they stay on the internal FileView: setText() passes through.
//
// A read is never applied when it is older than a write this object made. The
// write is asynchronous and the file is replaced in one rename, so a gated
// read that started before it lands after it holding the file as it was — and
// applying that undoes the save (a preset that vanished from the list right
// after being saved, pins that came back). Content read back is therefore
// accepted only when it carries the pending write, or when the retries below
// are spent, so an edit made outside the dock still wins in the end.

  // stops an in-flight gate when a newer read supersedes it, so traps are what
  // remove that staging file when this process is killed mid-read - and both
  // the signals and EXIT are named, because an EXIT-only trap covers the kill
  // on bash but not on dash (CI runs this suite where /bin/sh is dash, and the
  // staging file leaked there). The trap payload names $t in single quotes so
  // the shell expands it when the trap runs: interpolating the path into the
  // payload split it on spaces, and a TMPDIR holding one leaked the file. A
  // temporary directory that cannot be written falls back to /tmp rather than
  // leaving the dock unable to read its config.
